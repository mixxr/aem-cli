# AEM CLI
Adobe Experience Manager Administration CLI 

## Tested with
- AEM 6.4

## Usage
- populate the farm configuration file (it is a simple text file, see Farm Configuration File) with your farm addresses and credentials
- execute the farm-exec shell script
```bash
./farm-exec.sh <farm-config-file> <command> [<parameters>]
```
- read the output

## Examples
```bash
./farm-exec.sh file.txt purge audit
```
executes the maintenance audit task.

```bash
./farm-exec.sh file.txt users changepwd replication-receiver my-new-secret
```
changes the replication-receiver's password = my-new-secret.

```bash
./farm-exec.sh file.txt backup /backups/last 20
```
executes an on-line backup with target=/backups/last and delay=20.

```bash
./farm-exec.sh file.txt agents create-replicate author replic-000 http 10.10.1.15 4503 admin adminsecret;
```
creates on the author instance a Replication Agent named replic-001 that will replicate the server 10.10.1.15:4503.

```bash
./farm-exec.sh file.txt agents create-flush publish flush-001 https apache123.local 8080
```
creates on the publish instance a Flush Agent named flush-001 that will flush the web server apache123.local:8080 in HTTPS.

```bash
./farm-exec.sh file.txt users 
```
it will generate an error like the following:
```
users exits with error: MISSING ARGUMENTS.
Usage: users host:port user:pwd [enable|changepwd] userid [password_to_change]
```

## Farm Configuration File
```
NOTGOOD LINE 222
-- START
server1:4502 admin:admin
server2:4522 admin:admin
server3:4512 admin:pwd 
-- END
NOTGOOD LINE
```
The CLI executes only the lines between the `-- START` and `-- END`. During a command execution it could fail with one or more servers, so in place of writing a different file you can adjust the `-- START` and the `-- END` lines in order to complete the command.

## Report
The farm-exec executes and writes the output line by line as defined in the farm configuration file.

## How To Contribute
You can add scripts in the cmds folder by using your own scripting language (bash, ruby, ...)

- write your own script 
  - has to accept at least 2 parameters, that is the host:port and usrid:pwd at least
  - can accept more parameters to use in the script
  - finally, print a string to be used as Report
- save your script in the folder cmds
- add a usage example in the Examples section

### Command Example
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# usage: info.sh host:port user:pwd
curl -i -k -u $2 http://$1/system/console/status-productinfo.json 2>/dev/null | grep Manager
```

produces an output like the following:
```

localhost:4502 admin:admin " Adobe Experience Manager (6.4.0)",
localhost:4522 admin:admin " Product : Adobe Experience Manager (6.0.0.SNAPSHOT)", " Adobe Experience Manager (6.2.0)",
<--
```

### A Bit More Complex Command Example
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
usage () {
    cat <<HELP_USAGE
    backup host:port user:pwd target delay
HELP_USAGE
}

if [[ (-z "$3") || (-z "$4") ]]; then
    sh cmds/errors/generic $(usage)
    exit $?
fi
curl -w "%{http_code}\n"  -o /dev/null -isf -k -u $2 http://$1/libs/granite/backup/content/createBackup/content/items/backupform.html -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8' --data 'force=true&target='$3'&delay='$4 
```
It uses the generic error script that just prints a message and exit with 1.
Here the usage() function is an heredoc in place of echo/printf, this will help the reader looking the code.
